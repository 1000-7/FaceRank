## Face Rank - Rank Face by CNN Model based on TensorFlow

## Privacy
Because of privacy，the training images dataset is not provided.
maybe some carton images will be given later.

## Dataset
* 130 pictures with size 128*128 from web with tag
image: 1-3.jpg means rank 1,3st train pic
you can add your own pics to the resize_images folder

## Model
Model is CNN based on TensorFlow based on : https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/convolutional_network.py

## Run
After you installed TensorFlow ,just run train_model.py.
* train the model
* save the model to model dir

## Test
After you run the train_model.py ,just run the run_model.py to test.

## Download
The model is trained can be download at

## 图片像素要提高
## 增加数据集
## 在临近的层次，用公用的图片：比如1-3；4-6；7-9 用相似或者相同图片。
